# pixelart
Repository for the pixel art I've made that I want to back-up somewhere

All work is original, though credit to a friend of mine who will remain anonymous (unless they ask otherwise, I don't want to blow up their spot without permission) for the 'Ada Witch Art Low Res' for making the original art that I did a study on to make the lower resolution version here. They are a lovely, artistic genius.
